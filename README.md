# Gord0.ChunkMonkey.Attributes

Provides attributes for use with [Gordo0.ChunkyMonkey.CodeGenerator](https://github.com/andrew-gordon/Gordo0.ChunkyMonkey.CodeGenerator), a C# code generator that generates code, at build time, to split an object containing collection properties (arrays, lists, dictionaries etc) into chunks. It also provides the ability to merge the chunks back into a single object instance.
